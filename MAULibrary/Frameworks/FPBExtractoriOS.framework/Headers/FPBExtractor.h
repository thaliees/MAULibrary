/**
	This module will be responsible for providing the functions associated with the extraction of facial templates.
	<p>
	This class provides methods to perform the pattern extraction process from a sequence of images.
	</p>
	<p>
	The sequence of operations to perform this process is, firstly, initialize the extraction process
	by calling the <b>InitStreamExtraction</b> method specifying the number of images which composes
	the images extraction sequence. Secondly, the images of the sequence should be processed one by one by using the
	<b>ExtractNext</b> method.

	<p>
	In case that the extraction process had already been initialized and someone wish to abort
    it to start a new one, the first step is to abort the current
    extraction process by calling the <b>StopStreamExtraction</b> method, otherwise the system will
    return an exception.
